### SC1015 Data Science & AI Project
<img src="https://github.com/rlim066/RaymondL/blob/main/SC1015%20LOGO.png" width="512" >

Group project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science & AI.
Our team learned to process, extract and clean movie data from Kaggle‚Ñ¢ & tested out models to see which could best predict the IMDb scores of movies.

#### Models Used
* Numeric Linear Regression
* Multivariate Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regression

### Insights & Conclusions
* Rotten Tomatoes Score was the best metric in predicting the IMDb Score of Movie as the details that go into a complex score like IMDb score that describe multiple parts of a movie viewing experience is likely captured within Rotten Tomatoes Scores as well

* Variables like Runtime & Age of Movie have little significance on IMDb Score, does not affect how well it fairs in ratings

* High prediction errors is likely due to low correlation of variables used in predicting such as Runtime & Age of Movie. It would be better to search for variables with higher correlation for better predictions

* In predicting IMDb Score, Random Forest is less accurate & more resource intensive than Multi-Variate Linear Regression and not worth doing


### Overworked / Thrift It
